# Architecture

## Purpose

This document describes the current frontend architecture in this repository and the target architecture implied by the project direction.

## Current Architecture

### Runtime

- Framework: Next.js App Router
- Primary routes:
  - `/` in `src/app/page.js`
  - `/bars/[slug]` in `src/app/bars/[slug]/page.js`
- Metadata shell: `src/app/layout.js`
- Robots and sitemap:
  - `src/app/robots.js`
  - `src/app/sitemap.js`

### Content Layer

- Current source of truth for page content: `src/lib/content/mock-site-data.js`
- Current read API:
  - `getSiteData()`
  - `getBars()`
  - `getBarBySlug(slug)`
- Current adapter implementation: `src/lib/content/get-site-data.js`

### Media Layer

- Temporary media is stored in `public/mock`
- Components consume media as URL strings, not as imported files
- Hero media rendering is centralized in `src/components/hero-media.js`
- Gallery rendering is centralized in `src/components/bar-gallery.js`

### Rendering Pattern

1. Route reads from the content layer.
2. Route passes normalized data into UI components.
3. Page emits metadata and JSON-LD.
4. Sitemap generation reads the same bar list used for route generation.

### Global Shell

- `src/app/layout.js` sets fonts and site-wide metadata
- `src/components/age-gate.js` adds a client-side age gate
- `src/components/scroll-to-top.js` provides global scroll return behavior

## Current Boundary Decisions

- This repository is the frontend application, not the long-term editorial source of truth.
- Mock content exists because CMS integration is not yet implemented.
- Mock media in `public/mock` is allowed only as a temporary frontend development aid.

## Target Architecture

### Intended Runtime Responsibilities

Frontend repository:

- routing
- rendering
- SEO metadata generation
- JSON-LD generation
- presentation logic
- content-to-UI mapping

CMS and data systems:

- editable structured content
- draft and publish workflow
- media metadata
- editor permissions

Object storage or media service:

- photos
- videos
- menu PDFs
- posters and other binary assets

### Intended Content Path

1. Editor updates content in CMS.
2. CMS stores structured records and media references.
3. Frontend fetches published content through a content adapter.
4. Routes render normalized data without knowing CMS-specific field names.

## Current vs Target

| Area | Current | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content source | `mock-site-data.js` in repo | CMS outside repo |
| Bar route generation | `generateStaticParams()` from mock slug list | Slugs from CMS-backed source |
| Media source | `/public/mock/...` URLs | CMS-managed remote assets |
| Editorial workflow | code change required | non-developer content editing |
| Frontend responsibility | content + rendering mixed together | rendering and content adaptation separated |

## Integration Boundary To Preserve

The safest seam for future work is the content adapter in `src/lib/content`.

Frontend routes and components should depend on a stable internal data contract, while CMS-specific fetching and mapping stay behind the adapter layer.

## Provisional Assumptions

- The current single-domain route model remains the working default during the first CMS integration.
- The frontend will continue to statically enumerate bar slugs at build time unless a later requirement forces a more dynamic strategy.

## Open Questions

- Should the CMS integration support preview or draft mode in the first version?
- Should bar pages keep full static generation, or move to revalidation/on-demand publishing?
- Which CMS product will own the canonical schema and editorial workflow?
