# Content Model

## Purpose

This document defines:

- the content shape that exists today in the repository
- the target content entities needed for CMS-backed management
- ownership rules for editable content and media

It is intentionally data-focused and does not define frontend implementation steps.

## Current Implemented Model

The current content source is `src/lib/content/mock-site-data.js`.

It exports one top-level object with this shape:

```txt
mockSiteData
├── network
└── bars[]
```

## Content Ownership Rules

- Frontend code owns layout, rendering logic, and adapter logic.
- The long-term source of truth for editable content should be outside this repository.
- Production photos, videos, and menu files should be managed as external assets, not committed source files.
- Temporary mock media in `public/mock` is allowed only while the CMS flow is not implemented.

## Target CMS-Oriented Model

## Modeling Rules

- `slug` must be unique among published bars.
- Asset fields must reference CMS-managed media or external storage URLs, not local repo paths as the long-term source of truth.
- Bar ordering on the network page must be explicit, not dependent on accidental insertion order.
- Fields currently rendered by the frontend should not depend on optional nested rich-text structures.
- The first CMS version should prefer plain structured fields over highly flexible page-builder blocks.

## Provisional Assumptions

- Opening hours remain text lines in the first implementation because the current UI already consumes ordered strings.
- The first CMS version models events, gallery items, and menu links as separate collections or repeatable components rather than rich text.

## Open Questions

- Should phone and socials be fully local per bar, or inherit from network settings unless overridden?
- Should menu files be URLs only, or first-class managed assets with metadata?
- Does the project need coordinates and richer structured address fields in the first release, or is `address_line` sufficient?
